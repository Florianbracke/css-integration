***CSS-Integration*** <br>
In this excercise I tried to copy two interfaces. The goal was to be as pixel perfect as possible.

**You can find the project here** <br>

The project is nearly finished
I wish to spend some more time on giving the finishing touch to the styling of the <.hr> tags,
perhaps optimalising the media queries and finding the perfect fonts.
