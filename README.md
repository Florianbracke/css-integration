***CSS-Integration***
In this excercise I tried to copy two interfaces. The goal was to be as pixel perfect as possible.

**You can find the project here**
https://florianbracke.github.io/css-integration/ 

**status**
The project is nearly finished
I wish to spend some more time on giving the finishing touch to the styling of the <.hr> tags,
perhaps optimalising the media queries and finding the perfect fonts.
